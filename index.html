                    effortlessly
                    became an internationally recognized brand known for its commitment to health, strength, and
                    fitness.

                    don’t back down from the challenge to push our bodies to levels constantly challenging our limits.

            <h2>No Corporate Game</h2>
            <p>The Gym was founded in 1985 in San Diego CA, and has held onto what a gym really is. The Gym is a
                centerpiece of the community and holds a sacred bond and relationship to its members. The Gym is your
                second home and family that always has your back and is the place to make you better, The Gym never lets
                you down. The Fact of the matter is the fitness industry has been overpopulated and polluted with giant
                chains owned by large investment companies that attempt to create what a gym is; but at the end of the
                day they can't and never will. If you are interested in being a real gym, contact us direct for brand
                licensing and join the movement.</p>
